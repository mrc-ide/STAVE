STAVE is an R package designed for storing and managing **aggregate
spatial-temporal genetic data**. By “aggregate” we mean that data
consist solely of counts, i.e. numerators and denominators. By
“spatial-temporal” we mean that each observation is tied to a specific
geographic location (latitude and longitude), and a precise collection
time (a single day).

The primary goals of STAVE are:

1.  To provide a flexible data structure capable of storing genetic
    information that may contain differing levels of detail.
2.  To standardize data through a tightly defined format.
3.  To facilitate prevalence calculation.

All documentation, including installation instructions and tutorials,
are on [the STAVE website](https://mrc-ide.github.io/STAVE/).
