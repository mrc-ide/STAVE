STAVE is an R package designed for storing and managing **aggregate
spatial-temporal genetic data**. By “aggregate” we mean that data consist solely
of counts (numerator and denominator), rather than individual-level details. By
“spatial-temporal” we mean that each observation is tied to a specific
geographic location (latitude and longitude), and a precise collection time (a
single day).

Once data are loaded into STAVE it becomes straightforward to
calculate the prevalence of different genetic variants at each sampling
location, making this a useful format for data harmonization prior to spatial
analysis.

This site describes the [STAVE data format](articles/relational_structure.html).
It also contains [installation instructions](articles/installation.html) and
simple [tutorials](articles/reading_in_data.html) to help you get started.
