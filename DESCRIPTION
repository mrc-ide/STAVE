Description: STAVE is an R package for storing and managing aggregate spatial-temporal
    genetic data. Data are stored at the aggregate level (numerator and denominator) rather
    than at the individual level. STAVE centres around one main class; data are read into
    this class, and all data manipulation (e.g. calculating prevalence) takes place using member
    functions. Although STAVE is designed with *Plasmodium* genetic data in mind, it could be
    used to store genetic information from other organisms.
