STAVE is an R package designed for storing and managing **aggregate
spatial-temporal genetic data**. By “aggregate” we mean that data consist solely
of counts (numerator and denominator). By “spatial-temporal” we mean that each
observation is tied to a specific geographic location (latitude and longitude),
and a precise collection time (a single day). This format is a precursor to many
types of spatial analysis.

The primary goals of STAVE are:

1. To provide a flexible data structure that can accommodate genetic data with varying levels of detail.
2. To standardize data through a tightly defined format.
3. To facilitate prevalence calculation from aggregate counts.

All documentation, including installation instructions and tutorials, can be found on [the STAVE website](https://mrc-ide.github.io/STAVE/).
